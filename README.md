Hello! You can access the demo of the page through the following link:

[demo](https://error-404-devchallenges.netlify.app/)

My experience in Fullstack development, with emphasis on cutting-edge technology. It has allowed me to acquire solid skills. During this project, I focused my attention on improving responsive design with CSS, minimizing the use of media queries, and optimizing the layout using flexbox. This ensured an exceptional user experience across multiple devices.

I invite you to explore the demo and experience the result of these efforts for yourself. Thanks for your interest!
